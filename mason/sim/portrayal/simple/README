sim/portrayal/simple

This package holds 2D SimplePortrayals for displaying all sorts of 
objects in various Fields.  Theses SimplePortrayals are registered for 
various objects in the FieldPortrayals and called upon to portray those 
objects when asked.

The SimplePortrayals come in two basic forms: "basic" simple portrayals 
and "wrapper" portrayals.  Wrapper portrayals have (typically) one 
subsidiary simple portrayal and do some extra functionality, such as 
labelling the simple portrayal.  Many simple portrayals can be set up to 
do something special when the object is selected with the mouse: wrapper 
portrayals in particular are designed to make this easy so (for example) 
when you click on an object in the window, a label appears under it, 
then disappears when you click elsewhere.


RectanglePortrayal2D.java

A simple portrayal which draws the object as a rectangle.


OvalPortrayal2D.java

A simple portrayal which draws the object as an oval.


ShapePortrayal2D.java

A simple portrayal which draws the object as some provided Shape2D object.


ImagePortrayal2D.java

A simple portrayal which draws the object as a bitmap image or icon.


ValuePortryal2D.java

A special version of RectanglePortrayal2D, intended for use only with 
ValueGridPortrayal2D, which draws "values" (integers, doubles, etc.) as 
rectangles of certain colors.


CircledPortrayal2D.java

A wrapper portrayal which can draw a large circle around the object to 
highlight it.


LabelledPortrayal2D.java

A wrapper portrayal which can add a textual label to the object.


TransformedPortrayal.java

A wrapper portrayal which can transform (scale, rotate, translate) the
underlying portrayal as desired.


OrientedPortrayal.java 

A wrapper portrayal which can draw an orientation marker indicating how 
the underlying object is "oriented" (assuming the object implements the 
Oriented2D interface).  Optionally, OrientedPortrayal2D doesn't need a 
subsidiary portrayal, and can draw various oriented shapes (compasses, 
kites).
