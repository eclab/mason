sim/portrayal

This package holds visualization objects (called 'Portrayals') which 
represent either (1) fields or (2) objects stored in those fields.  
Portrayals which represent fields are called FieldPortrayals.  
Portrayals which represent objects are called SimplePortrayals.

The package contains the top-level Portrayal class (Portrayal); plus
various 2D portrayals, plus inspectors (see below).  3D portrayals are
stored in the sim/portrayal3D package instead.

When you double-click on a portrayed object in the visualization 
toolkit, MASON will pop up an Inspector -- a JComponent which lets you 
examine the inner workings of the object and modify them.  Inspectors 
come in many flavors, but the primary to are plain Inspectors and 
PropertyInspectors.  A plain Inspector inspects an object (the most 
common plain Inspector is SimpleInspector).  A PropertyInspector 
inspects a single property of an object.  Property inspectors include 
charting facilities, systems which stream the value of the property out 
to a file, etc.

Plain Inspectors are stored in this package.  PropertyInspectors are 
largely stored in the sim/portrayal/inspector packge.


The subpackages are:

grid		FieldPortrayals for 2D grids
continuous	FieldPortrayals for 2D continuous space.
network		FieldPortrayals for 2D representations of networks
simple		SimplePortrayals for basic objects of all kinds.
inspector	PropertyInspectors of various kinds.


Classes:


Portrayal.java

An interface for all Portrayals, both 2D and 3D.


Portrayal2D.java

An interface for all 2D Portrayals, both FieldPortrayals and 
SimplePortrayals.


FieldPortrayal.java

An abstract superclass of all FieldPortrayals.  Contains a mechanism for 
storing SimplePortrayals and associating them with objects in the Field.  
When a FieldPortrayal is called upon to draw itself (or certain other 
tasks), it does so by going through the objects stored in its Field and, 
for each object, looking up the stored SimplePortrayal responsible for 
drawing (etc.) that kind of object, then asking the SimplePortrayal to 
do the task.


FieldPortrayal2D.java

An abstract superclass of all 2D FieldPortrayals.


SimplePortrayal2D.java

A superclass of all 2D SimplePortrayals.  The default SimplePortrayal 
doesn't portray objects as anything (they're invisible).


Inspector.java

An abstract superclass of widgets designed to "inspect" (view and modify 
the internals of) objects and fields.  Sometimes called "probes" in 
simulators like SWARM.


SimpleInspector.java

A basic concrete implementation of Inspector which displays all the 
properties of the object being inspected.


LocationWrapper.java

A simple abstract class which stores and provides objects, their names 
(as Strings), the field portrayals they're stored in, and their 
locations in those field portrayals.  Most SimplePortrayals create 
special subclasses of LocationWrappers of their underlying objects and 
hand those off to SimpleInspector to inspect.  Provides a clean 
procedure for bundling all the information needed to inspect an object 
in a field.


Oriented2D.java

A simple interface for declaring that an object has an orientation as 
well as a location.


DrawInfo2D.java

A class containing information about where and how to draw portrayals,
specifically: their location, their scale, and clip rect information (so
you can determine if you should even bother drawing); and also whether
the drawing should be done "precisely" (for PDF output, for example).
Passed to all 2D Portrayals when they're asked to portray their objects.

InspectPressed.png	A "pressed" spyglass icon for inspecting objects.
