/**
   A storage facility for sparse objects in discrete 2D space, using Maps.  SparseGrid2D differs from ObjectGrid2D
   in several respects:
    
   <ul>
   <li>SparseGrid2D can store more than one object at a location.  ObjectGrid2D cannot.
   <li>ObjectGrid2D can store an object at more than one location (though it's bad form!).
   <li>SparseGrid2D can efficiently (O(1)) tell you the location of an object.
   <li>SparseGrid2D can efficiently (O(#objs)) scan through all objects.  The best you can do with ObjectGrid2D is search its array (which might have many empty slots).
   <li>Storing an object, finding its location, or changing its location, in a SparseGrid2D is O(1) but requires several Map lookups and/or removes, which has a significant constant overhead.
   <li>SparseGrid2D can associate objects with <i>any</i> 2D integer location.  ObjectGrid2D's locations are restricted to be within its array.
   </ul>

   <p>Generally speaking, if you have a grid of objects, one per location, you should use an ObjectGrid2D.  If you have a large grid occupied by a few objects, or those objects can pile up on the same grid location, you should use a SparseGrid2D.
    
   <p>In either case, you might consider storing the location of an object IN THE OBJECT ITSELF if you need to query for the object location often -- it's faster than the hashtable lookup in SparseGrid2D, and certainly faster than searching the entire array of an ObjectGrid2D.

   <p><b>Boundaries.</b>  SparseGrid2D has no boundaries at all.  <tt>width</tt> and <tt>height</tt> exist only to allow
   you to define pseudo-boundaries for toroidal computation; and to provide typical bounds for visualization.  But you can
   attach any coordinate as a location for an object with no restrictions.
        
   <b>Setting and getting an object and its Location.</b>  The method <b>setObjectLocation(...)</b> methods set the location of the object
   (to an Int2D or an <x,y> location).
   The method <b>getObjectsAtLocation(Object location)</b>, inherited from SparseField, returns a Bag (which you MUST NOT modify)
   containing all objects at a given location (which must be provided in the form of an Int2D or MutableInt2D).  The <b>numObjectsAtLocation(location)</b>
   method returns the number of such objects.  The <b>getObjectsAtLocations(Bag locations, Bag putInHere)</b> gathers objects
   at a variety of locations and puts them in the bag you provide.  The <b>getAllObjects()</b> method returns all objects in a bag you
   must NOT modiify.  The <b>removeObjectsAtLocation(Object location)</b> method removes and returns all objects at a given location
   (defined as an Int2D or MutableDouble2D).  The <b>exists</b> method tells you if the object exists in the field.
        
   <p><b>Neighborhood Lookups.</b>  The method <b>getObjectsAtLocationOfObject</b> returns all Objects at the same location as the provided
   object (in a Bag, which must NOT modify).  The various <b>getNeighbors...Distance(...)</b> methods return all locations defined by certain
   distance bounds, or all the objects stored at those locations.  They are expensive to compute and it may be wiser to compute them by hand
   if there aren't many.
