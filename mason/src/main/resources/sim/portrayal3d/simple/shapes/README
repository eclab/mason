sim/portrayal3d/simple/shapes

This package holds a few sample shapes which you can load into
sim.portrayal3d.simple.Shape3DPortrayal3D.  The shapes are believed
to be in the public domain.  Note that certain shapes normally 
distributed with Java3D as examples (such as galleon.obj) are not
open source: you cannot resell them.  Thus MASON can't include them.
