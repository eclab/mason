sim/util/media

This package holds utility classes on which MASON relies to create 
media: movies, pictures, and charts. All of these classes can be 
extracted and used for other tasks and don't rely on anything outside of 
sim/util.


The subpackages are:

chart		Utility classes for creating charts


Classes:



MovieEncoder.java

A class which relies on Java Media Framework (JMF) to create movies from 
collections of snapshots of a widget.  The sim/util/gui/MovieMaker.java 
class wraps this in a nice GUI and is easier to use.


PNGEncoder.java

A class, written by J. David Eisenberg, which writes out PNG files.


PDFEncoder.java

A class which writes out PDF files.  Uses the iText library to do its magic.
