/**
   A storage facility for objects located in a continuous 2D environment.  This facility relates
   objects with 2D double tuples (in the form of Double2D).  The facility extends SparseField, and like
   other objects which extend SparseField (such as SparseGrid2D), the facility can only relate any given
   object with a single location at a time -- that is, an object cannot hold two locations at once in 
   the Continuous2D field.

   <p>Because hashtable lookups are more expensive than just storing the object, we suggest that you ALSO
   store the location of an object in the object itself, so you can read from the object rather than having
   to call getObjectLocation(object).

   <p>The Continuous2D has been arranged to make neighborhood lookup information reasonably efficient.
   It discretizes the space into grid buckets.  The discretization size of the buckets is
   provided in the constructor and cannot be changed thereafter.  If the discretization was 0.7,
   for example, then one bucket would be (0,0) to (under 0.7, under 0.7), another bucket would be (0,0,0.7)
   to (under 0.7, under 1.4), etc.
   
   <p>You can use Continuous2D to look up objects in a given region by asking for objects within the
   enclosing buckets, then rummaging through the buckets to find the individuals actually in the desired
   region.  The trick here is to come up with a good bucket size.  If the bucket size is much larger than
   the typical size of a neighborhood lookup, then a typical lookup will include large numbers of objects
   you don't care about; in the worst case, this is an O(n) lookup for something that could have been much
   smaller.  On the other hand, if the bucket size is much smaller than the typical size of a neighborhood
   lookup, then you have to do lots of bucket lookups to cover your range; many if not most of these buckets
   could be empty.  This can also be highly inefficient.

   <p>Stored objects are best thought of as one of two types: <b>point objects</b> and <b>non-point objects</b>.
   A point object is represented in space by a single point.  It has no area or volume.  A non-point object
   has area or volume.  You specify whether or not your objects are point or non-point objects when calling
   getNeighborsWithinDistance().  The distinction matters when you care about this function returning either all
   the objects whose point location is within the distance range, or returning all the (non-point) the objects which
   could possibly overlap with the range.  

   <p>This distinction also is important when determining the discretization size
   of your grid.  If your objects are point objects, you have no minimum bound on the discretization size.  But if
   the object are non-point location objects (that is, they have dimensions of width, height, etc.), and
   you care about this overlap when you do distance lookups, then you have a minimum bound on your
   discretization.  In this case, you want to make certain that your discretization is at LEAST larger than
   the LARGEST dimension of any object you plan on putting in the Continuous2D.  The idea here is that if an
   any part of an object fell within the bounding box for your distance lookup task 
   (see getNeighborsWithinDistance(...)), you're guaranteed that the stored location of the object must be within
   a bounding box 1 discretization larger in each direction.

   <p>Okay, so that gives you the minimum discretization you should use.  What about the maximum discretization?
   It depends largely on the number of objects expected to occupy a given discretized bucket region, and on what
   kind of lookups you need to do for objects within a given distance.  Searching through one bucket is a hash
   table lookup.  A smaller discretization returns a more accurate sample of objects within the requested
   bounding box, but requires more hash table lookups.  If you have <b>point location</b> objects, and 
   your field is very dense (LOTS of objects in a bucket on average), then we recommend a
   discretization equal to the maximum range distance you are likely to look up; but if your field is very sparse,
   then we recommend a discretization equal to twice the maximum range distance.  You have to tune it.  If you
   have <b>non-point-location</b> objects, then you have two choices.  One approach is to assume a discretization 
   equal to the maximum range distance, but when doing lookups with getNeighborsWithinDistance(...), you need to
   state that you're using non-point-location objects.  If you're fairly sparse and your objects aren't big, you
   can set the discretization to twice the maximum range distance, and you should be safe calling getNeighborsWithinDistance()
   pretending that your objects are point-location; this saves you a lot of hash table lookups.

   <p>At any rate, do NOT go below the minimum discretization rules. 

   <p>But wait, you say, I have objects of widely varying sizes.  Or I have many different neighborhood lookup
   range needs.  Never fear.  Just use multiple Continuous2Ds of different discretizations.  Depending on your
   needs, you can put all the objects in all of the Continuous2Ds (making different range lookups efficient)
   or various-sized classes of objects in their own Continuous2Ds perhaps.  You have to think this through based
   on your needs.  If all the objects were in all of the Continuous2Ds, you'd think that'd be inefficient in
   moving objects around.  Not really: if the discretizations doubled (or more) each time, you're looking at 
   typically an O(ln n) number of Continuous2Ds, and a corresponding number of lookups.

   <p>Continuous2D objects have a width and a height, but this is used for two functions: first, to determine
   the bounds for toroidal functions.  Second, to determine the bounds for drawing on the screen in a portrayal.
   Otherwise, width and height are not used.  If your space is bounded, you should set the width and height to
   those bounds.  If it's unbounded, then you should set the width and height to the bounds you would like
   displayed on-screen.
