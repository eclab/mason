/** 
 *    Define basic neighborhood functions for 2D Grids.  The basic interface defines a width and a height
 *    (not all grids require a width and a height unless you're doing toroidal grids), and basic math for
 *    toroidal computation, hex grid location, and triangular grid location.
 *    
 *    <H3>Toroidal Computation</H3>
 *    
 *    <p>If you're using the Grid to define a toroidal (wrap-around) world, you can use the <b>tx</b>
 *    and <b>ty</b> methods to simplify the math for you.  For example, to increment in the x direction,
 *    including wrap-around, you can do:  x = tx(x+1).
 *    
 *    <p>If you're sure that the values you'd pass into the toroidal functions would not wander off more than
 *    a grid dimension in either direction (height, width), you can use the slightly faster toroidal functions
 *    <b>stx</b> and <b>sty</b> instead.  For example, to increment in the x direction,
 *    including wrap-around, you can do:  x = stx(x+1).  See the documentation on these functions for
 *    when they're appropriate to use.  Under most common situations, they're okay.
 *
 *    <p>In HotSpot 1.4.1, stx, and sty are inlined.  In Hotspot 1.3.1, they are not (they contain if-statements).
 *    
 *    <H3>Hex Grid Computation</H3>
 *    Grids can be used for both squares and hex grids.  Hex grids are stored in an ordinary
 *    rectangular array and are defined as follows:
 *    
 *<pre>
 *<tt>
 *        (0,0)            (2,0)            (4,0)            (6,0)            ...
 *                (1,0)            (3,0)            (5,0)            (7,0)            ...
 *        (0,1)            (2,1)            (4,1)            (6,1)            ...
 *                (1,1)            (3,1)            (5,1)            (7,1)            ...
 *        (0,2)            (2,2)            (4,2)            (6,2)            ...
 *                (1,2)            (3,2)            (5,2)            (7,2)            ...
 *        ...              ...              ...              ...              ...
 *                ...              ...              ...              ...              ...
 *</tt>
 *</pre>    
 *    
 *<p>The rules moving from a hex location (at CENTER) to another one are as follows:
 *
 *<pre>
 *<tt>
 *                                                UP
 *                                                x
 *            UPLEFT                            y - 1                   UPRIGHT
 *            x - 1                                                     x + 1
 *            ((x % 2) == 0) ? y - 1 : y                CENTER                  ((x % 2) == 0) ? y - 1 : y
 *                                                x
 *            DOWNLEFT                            y                                             DOWNRIGHT
 *            x - 1                                                     x + 1
 *            ((x % 2) == 0) ? y : y + 1                DOWN                    ((x % 2) == 0) ? y : y + 1
 *                                                x
 *                                                                                              y + 1
 *
 *</tt>
 *</pre>
 *   NOTE: (x % 2 == 0), that is, "x is even", may be written instead in this faster way: ((x & 1) == 0)
 *
 * <p>Because the math is a little hairy, we've provided the math for the UPLEFT, UPRIGHT, DOWNLEFT,
 *  and DOWNRIGHT directions for you.  For example, the UPLEFT location from [x,y] is at
 *  [ulx(x,y) , uly(x,y)].  Additionally, the toroidal methods can be used in conjunction with the 
 *  hex methods to implement a toroidal hex grid.  Be sure to  <b>To use a toroidal hex grid properly,
 *   you must ensure that height of the grid is an even number</b>.  For example, the toroidal 
 *   UPLEFT X location is at tx(ulx(x,y)) and the UPLEFT Y location is at ty(uly(x,y)).  Similarly, 
 *   you can use stx and sty.
 *
 * <p>While this interface defines various methods common to many grids, you should endeavor not to 
 * call these grids casted into this interface: it's slow.  If you call the grids' methods directly 
 * by their class, their methods are almost certain to be inlined into your code, which is very fast.
 * 
 *     <H3>Triangular Grid Computation</H3>
 *    
 *    Grids can also be used for triangular grids instead of squares.  Triangular grids look like this:
 *
 *    <pre><tt>
 *    -------------------------
 *    \(0,0)/ \(2,0)/ \(4,0)/ \
 *     \   /   \   /   \   /   \    ...
 *      \ /(1,0)\ /(3,0)\ /(5,0)\
 *       -------------------------
 *      / \(1,1)/ \(3,1)/ \(5,1)/
 *     /   \   /   \   /   \   /    ...
 *    /(0,1)\ /(2,1)\ /(4,1)\ /
 *    -------------------------
 *    \(0,2)/ \(2,2)/ \(4,2)/ \
 *     \   /   \   /   \   /   \    ...
 *      \ /(1,2)\ /(3,2)\ /(5,2)\
 *       -------------------------
 *      / \(1,3)/ \(3,3)/ \(5,3)/
 *     /   \   /   \   /   \   /    ...
 *    /(0,3)\ /(2,3)\ /(4,3)\ /
 *    -------------------------
 *               .
 *               .
 *               .
 *    </tt></pre> 
 *
 *    <p>How do you get around such a beast?  Piece of cake!  Well, to go to your right or left 
 *    neighbor, you just add or subtract the X value.  To go to your up or down neighbor, all you 
 *    do is add or subtract the Y value.  All you need to know is if your triangle has an edge on 
 *    the top (so you can go up) or an edge on the bottom (so you can go down).  The functions TRB 
 *    (triangle with horizontal edge on 'bottom') and TRT (triangle with horizontal edge on 'top') 
 *    will tell you this.
 *
 *    <p>Like the others, the triangular grid can <i>also</i> be used in toroidal fashion, and the 
 *    toroidal functions should work properly with it. <b>To use a <i>toroidal</i> triangular grid, 
 *    you should ensure that your grid's length and width are <i>both</i> even numbers.</b>
 *
 *    <p>We'll provide a distance-measure function for triangular grids just as soon as we figure out
 *    what the heck one looks like.  :-)
