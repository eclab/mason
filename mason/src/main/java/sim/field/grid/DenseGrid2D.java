   A wrapper for 2D arrays of Objects.

   <p>This object expects that the 2D arrays are rectangular.  You are encouraged to access the array
   directly.  The object
   implements all of the Grid2D interface.  See Grid2D for rules on how to properly implement toroidal
   or hexagonal grids.

   <p>The width and height of the object are provided to avoid having to say field[x].length, etc.

   <p>We very strongly encourage you to examine <b>SparseGrid2D</b> first to see if it's more appropriate to your task.  If you need arbitrary numbers of Objects to be able to occupy the same location in the grid, or if you have very few Objects and a very large grid, or if your space is unbounded, you should probably use SparseGrid2D instead.
