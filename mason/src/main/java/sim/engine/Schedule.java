/**
   Schedule defines a threadsafe scheduling queue in which events can be scheduled to occur
   at future time.  The time of the most recent event which has already occured
   is given by the <b>getTime()</b> method.  If the current time is <tt>BEFORE_SIMULATION</tt> (defined
   to be <tt>EPOCH - 1</tt>),
   then the schedule is set to the "time before time" (the schedule hasn't started running
   yet).  If the current time is <tt>AFTER_SIMULATION</tt> (positive infinity), then the schedule has run
   out of time.  <tt>EPOCH</tt> (0.0) is defined as the first timestep for which you can legally schedule a value.
   <tt>EPOCH_PLUS_ESPILON</tt> is defined as the smallest possible second timestep for which you can legally sechedule a value.
   If you're scheduling events to occur on integer timesteps, you may want to ensure that your simulation 
   does not run beyond <tt>MAXIMUM_INTEGER</tt> (9007199254740992L or 9.007199254740992E15).  For values of a 
   double d >= <tt>MAXIMUM_INTEGER</tt>, d + 1 == d !

   <p>An event is defined as a <b>Steppable</b> object. You can schedule events to either 
   occur a single time or to occur repeatedly at some interval.  If the event occurs repeatedly,
   the schedule will provide you with a <b>Stoppable</b> object on which you can call <b>stop()</b>
   to cancel all future repeats of the event.  If instead you wish to "stop" a single-time event from occuring
   before its time has come, you should do so through the use of a <b>TentativeStep</b> object.  At present
   you cannot delete objects from the Schedule -- just stop them and let them drop out in due course.
   
   <p>The schedule is pulsed by calling its <b>step(...)</b> method.  Each pulse, the schedule
   finds the minimum time at which events are scheduled, moves ahead to that time, and then calls
   all the events scheduled at that time.    Multiple events may be scheduled for the same time.
   No event may be scheduled for a time earlier than getTime().  If at time getTime() you schedule a new
   event for time getTime(), then actually this event will occur at time getTime()+epsilon, that is, the
   smallest possible slice of time greater than getTime().

   <p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> we have disabled the setShuffling() procedure by making the methods private.  The reason for this is that although turning off shuffling causes the Steppables to be stepped in a <i>predictable order</i>, they will not necessarily be stepped in <i>the order in which they were submitted</i>, which was the whole point of the methods.  The reason for this is that a binary heap is not "stable": it doesn't break ties by returning elements in the same order in which they appeared.  This potentially could cause bugs in simulations and we want to make it very clear.
  
   <p>Events at a step are further subdivided and scheduled according to their <i>ordering</i>, an integer.
   Objects for scheduled for lower orderings for a given time will be executed before objects with
   higher orderings for the same time.  If objects are scheduled for the same time and
   have the same ordering value, their execution will be randomly ordered with respect to one another.
   
   <!-- 
   unless (in the very rare case) you have called setShuffling(false);.  Generally speaking, most experiments with
   good model methodologies will want random shuffling left on, and if you need an explicit ordering, it may be
   better to rely on Steppable's orderings or to use a Sequence.
   -->
   
   <p>You might be wondering: why bother with using orderings?  After all, can't you achieve the same thing by just
   stretching elements out in time?  There are two reasons to use orderings.  First, it allows you to use the getTime()
   method to keep tabs on the current time in a way that might be convenient to you.  But second and more importantly,
   MASON's GUI facility will update its displays and inspectors only after all Steppables scheduled for a 
   given timestamp have completed, and so orderings give you a way of subdividing the interval of time between
   GUI updates.
   
   <p>A schedule may be <i>sealed</i> meaning that it will refuse to accept any further scheduled events
   even if its time is not yet AFTER_SIMULATION.  This is largely done internally by MASON code: you probably
   will never want to do this.  Once a schedule is sealed it cannot be unsealed until it is reset().
   
   <p>You can clear out the entire Schedule, unseal it, and restart it to BEFORE_SIMULATION by calling reset().
   However, this does not prevent AsynchronousSteppables from suddenly rescheduling themselves
   in the queue.  Stopping the simulation from within a Steppable object's step() method is best done by
   calling SimState.kill().  From the main thread, the most straightforward way to stop a simulation is to just
   stop calling schedule.step(...), and proceed directly to SimState.finish().
   
   <p>You can get the number of times that step(...) has been called on the schedule by calling the getSteps() method.
   This value is incremented just as the Schedule exits its step(...) method and only if the method returned true.
   Additionally, you can get a string version of the current time with the getTimestamp(...) method.
   
   <p><b>Note on Synchronization</b>.  In order to maximize the ability for threads to access the Schedule at any time, 
   Schedule uses two locks for synchronization.  First, the <b>step() method synchronizes on the Schedule</b> itself.  This
   prevents step() from being called simultaneously from different threads; also step() tests to make sure that it's not
   called reentrantly from within the same thread.  Second, <b>many methods synchronize on an internal lock</b>, including step().
   This allows step() to synchronize on the lock only to suck out the relevant Steppables from the Heap and to advance the timestep;
   all other portions of step() are outside of the lock.  Thus when step() actually steps the Steppables, even in different threads
   (like AsynchronousSteppable or ParallelSequence), they can turn around and submit step-requests to the Schedule even while it's still
   in its step() method.
   
   <p>One downside to this flexibility is that it's very inefficient to check, at each step of a Steppable, whether the Schedule
   has been reset or not.  Thus now if you call reset() or [better] SimState.kill(), the Schedule will continue to step Steppables
   until it has exhausted ones scheduled for the current timestep.  Only at that point will it cease.
   
   <p><b>Heaps and Calendar Queues</b>.  Schedule uses a plain-old binary heap for its queueing mechanism.  This is reasonably efficient,
   but it could be made more efficient with a Calendar Queue designed for the purposes of your simulation.  We settled on a Heap because
   we do not know what the expected scheduling pattern will be for any given simulation, and so had to go for the most general case.  If you'd
   care to customize your queue, you can do so by overriding the createHeap() method in a custom Schedule.  We imagine this would be rare.
