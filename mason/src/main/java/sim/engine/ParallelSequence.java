/** Spawns all the sequence elements in parallel on separate threads.
    This should ONLY be used if you know that all of the elements in
    the sequence can be executed independently of one another without
    any race conditions.  No synchronization on the model data is done --
    you're responsible for that if you need it.
    
    <p>For example, keep in mind that the random number generator is unsynchronized.
    If you access the random number generator from within a ParallelSequence, or
    indeed from multiple threads you've spawned in other situations, you need
    to remember to lock on the random number generator itself.
    
    <p>In the same vein, if you use a RandomSequence within a ParallelSequence, you need
    to let the RandomSequence know this so that it will lock on the random number generator
    properly.  This is done by setting the <b>shouldSynchronize</b> flag in the RandomSequence.
    
    <p>ParallelSequences are lightweight: they reuse the same threads
    if stepped repeatedly.  This means that you must never attach a ParallelSequence
    inside itself -- that'd be an infinite loop, but it also would create weird thread
    errors.
    
    <p>While ParallelSequences might LOOK cool, generally speaking the only time you should
    ever think to use them is if you actually HAVE multiple CPUs on your computer.  Otherwise
    they're almost certainly not the solution to your odd multiple-thread needs.

    <p><b>Important Note</b>
    Because ParallelSequences are lightweight, their threads are persistent, even after your step()
    method has completed (this allows them to be reused for the next step() method.  If the ParallelSequence
    is garbage collected, we automatically delete all its threads in its finalize() method.  And that's the
    rub: even if you get rid of your ParallelSequence, it's often the case that its garbage collection is
    delayed, or even that the VM will <i>never</i> garbage collect it.
        
    <p>Thus when you're done with your ParallelSequence and wish to throw it away, you should always
    call <b>cleanup()</b>, which deletes the threads manually.  Otherwise the thread resources will leak
    and quickly consume all your available memory.
        
    <p>Alternatively you can call <b>setDestroysThreads(true)</b>  on your ParallelSequence.  This will
    cause the ParallelSequence to destroy its threads every single time the ParallelSequence's step()
    method completes.  This is expensive but you don't have to keep track of the ParallelSequence
    at the end of the run to call cleanup() on it.  It's not a bad idea for a ParallelSequence which
    is one-shot rather than repeating.
    
    <p>Be sure to read the class documentation on sim.engine.Sequence</b>
