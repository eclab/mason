<h2>City Migration</h2>

<p>This model depicts the migration of displaced people in a 1,000 mile square region encompassing
Lake Victoria and the Rift Valley of Eastern Africa.</p>
    
<p>Initially, displaced people relocate to the nearest city and cities are connected in two different networks. 
The city-interaction network, used when choosing a destination for internally displaced persons (IDPs), has edges
based on the strength of the interaction between each pair of cities. This is calculated as the product of the cities’ 
sizes divided by the distance between them raised to some power. This type of spatial interaction model is sometimes 
referred to as a “gravity” model because it takes the same form as the equation for the gravitational force between 
two objects. The outbound links with the highest interaction for each city are kept as edges in the network.</p>

<p>The second network used in the migration model is used for transportation and represents the roads that a group 
of displaced people would use when traveling between two cities. This transportation network is a scrubbed and 
simplified version of the region’s road network.</p>

<p>When the number of displaced people in a city exceeds that city’s capacity, the city expels some of them. 
Their destination is chosen stochastically from among the neighboring cities in the interaction network with 
the most spare capacity. Nearer cities are more likely to be chosen than farther ones. Once a destination is 
chosen, a path is planned through the transportation network and the IDPs are sent on their way. As the IDP 
group reaches a city along the path to its destination, they may choose a new final destination if one becomes available.</p>
