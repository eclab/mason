ISSUES
------
DATE    COMPLETED	DESCRIPTION AUTHOR
2013-05-14  [ ] FIXME: Farm wealth increases linearly forever.  Need to implement spoilage.
2013-05-09	[x]	FIXME: When buying TLU's to start a new herd, need to make sure we save enough wealth to feed the farm until the next harvest.  Siggy
2013-05-09	[x]	FIXME: We have altered activity management to occur annually, but ActivityRestartHistory still thinks in days.  Siggy
2013-05-09	[x]	FIXME: The vegetation model appears broken, but worked fine a few months ago.  Find out when and why it broke.  Siggy
2013-05-09	[x]	TODO: Review the initialization of Household wealth, to make sure they have enough to eat for the first year or two.    Siggy
2013-05-09	[x]	FIXME: Reproduction (population increase) needs to be handled on the Household level.  It is/was handled by each Activity before.   Siggy
2013-03-19	[ ]	FIXME: Voronoi seems to have improper behavior. Siggy
2013-03-19	[x]	TODO: Jitter herder portrayals.   Siggy
2013-03-19	[ ]	TODO: Need unit test for implementing drought in weather clusters. Siggy
2013-03-19	[ ]	FIXME: Displaced households still show up on their farm parcel.   Siggy
2013-03-19	[ ]	FIXME: Ought to (and currently doesn't) have areas that start with farms (herds) stay with farms (herds) over a long run.    Siggy
2013-03-19	[ ]	Optimization idea: Don't start with a herd in high-density areas.   Siggy
2013-03-19	[x]	FIXME: Initial ratio of herders to farmers is out of whack, as identified by Bill. Siggy
2013-03-08	[ ]	getCoveringObjects() is used incorrectly Land.lookUpCountry(), leading to "Unknown country id: 0" errors in all Households.  This is my fault.   Siggy
2013-03-05	[x]	Bookkeeping of which activities are net productive and which are not. Currently keeping track of N^2 tallies, e.g. totHerdersSupportedbyFarm    Joey
2013-03-05	[x]	Feeding of people, both supported and unsupported    Joey
2013-03-05	[x]	ActivityManager.startFarmingActivity(...) takes a household as a parameter. Don't.    Joey
2013-03-05	[x]	Get rid of g/setReachedMinimumSplitPopulation() and the associated flag. Just check the threshold instead.    Joey

-------------

Broken model semantics:
[x] Herds go into "suspended animation" when they return home for planting and at least some of them never leave.
[x] Keep track of household food management better

Items from the whiteboard:
[ ] Household reproduction
[x] Init starting wealth of households
[x] Adjust ActivityRestartHistory to think in years for farming (remove commented-out code)
[x] Num people allocated to activity proportional to productivity. Watch out for integer effects.
[x] Fix parameter constraints
[x] Make sure not everyone goes to labor 
[x] Ensure there's enough food to feed household until next harvest before restarting herding and buying a herd
[/] Make activities shut themselves down if their population becomes zero
[x] Farm restarting : Land allocation?
[x] Rebalance when there is no farming
[x] Farm initialization to zero?
[x] Re-enable household splitting and displacement from Household.step()

[x] Randomize the endOfPseudoAnnualCycle (eventually)
[x] Make a chart showing non-displaced population

Rainfall & Vegetation Growth:
[x] Grass seems to be growing too well. Check weather/vegetation model.
[x] Figure out why vegetation growth is broken
[x] Harvest becomes less productive over time in a strange parabolic way
[x] GrazeableAreas are showing a normalized vegetation density of 0, which shouldn't be possible
[x] Why does the upper-left quadrant sub-area have stripes?
[ ] Why can't the full model run with zero population?
[x] The file ndvi2001001.asc contains negative NDVI values.

Moving toward August:
[x] Joey and Bill will put together a standalone disaster/migration model
[ ] Carrying capacity of households with farming only
[ ] Carrying capacity of households with herding only
[ ] Carrying capacity of households with both farming and herding
[ ] Ratio of herding to farming should conform to ethnic patterns

[ ] Rework the colorMap of waterholes to go from 0 to "plenty" on a non-linear scale
[x] Consider the reinstatement of dynamically adjusted growing season lengths
[x] The evaluation of parcels in herding needs to include the current location
[ ] Figure out what CurrentFractionOpenParcels means and why it's negative

[x] Why aren't there any laborers when we run without herding?
[x] Displaced population grows linearly when everyone has been displaced
[x] Fix the bug where a household with herding but only 1 TLU tries to split
[ ] Change all mentions of HerdAssets to HerdSize
[x] Households are still being stepped after they're displaced

[x] Have permanent water sources

[x] Remove disaster code from Riftland
[ ] Add to parameters: MarginalReturnToLabor, InitialHouseholdEndowment
[/] ActivityManager.restartFarming -> FarmSearch.findNewFarmLoc returns null when all parcels are at 100% farming. (With only farming.) Should be handled better.
[x] Verify that herding evaluateParcel is looking at the non-farmed vegetation
[x] Farming gets restarted occasionally even when farming is disabled
[x] Make sure household.canFarm (and canHerd) get set in splitHousehold
[x] Change shouldCommitToFarming and shouldCommitToHerding to use and exponential form for the restart delay function
[x] Herd reproduction is a fixed chance of adding one TLU, but should be based on herd size

[x] Create a parameter for setting a string of weather years
[x] Don't herd if area is at full farming intensity (maybe, if there's a way to do this right)
[ ] Cache the culture ID in each parcel instead of using GeoMason queries everytime
[ ] Make a parameter out of the threshold Tim is using in ActivityManager.shouldCommitToHerding

===============================================
Parameters that can be adjusted to change the relative productivity of farming, herding, and labor:
Farming:
[X] MaxWorkableLandPerFarmer: amount of farm land per farmer at which productivity peaks (currently 1ha/farmer). Needs to be used in splitting and restarting, etc.
[X] FarmIntensificationExponent (currently called MARGINAL_RETURN_TO_LABOR): Controls how much additional production comes from an additional farmer
[X] KgOfGrainPerPersonDay: Amount of grain, in kg, that a person eats in one day
[X] MaxMoveDistanceForNewHousehold (called maxDepth in FarmSearch.findNewFarmLoc())
[X] FarmingRestartProbabilityExponent: Controls how quickly a household will give up on farming (larger is more persistent)
[ ] BASE_FARM_YIELD_FACTOR: Currently a constant


Herding:
  Behavior:
[X] HerdingFoodWeight: used while choosing a grazing location and when choosing a new waterhole
[X] HerdingWaterWeight: used while choosing a grazing location and when choosing a new waterhole
[X] HerdingDistanceWeight: used while choosing a grazing location and when choosing a new waterhole
[X] HerdingHomeWeight: used when choosing a new waterhole
[X] ReturnHomeCheckInterval: used in Herding.shouldReturn (optimization)
[X] PlentyOfWaterInTLUDays (currently an ungodly mix of numberOfHerdsWateredByPlentyOfWater and magic numbers)

  Physiology:
[X] TLUFoodConsumptionRate: how much each animal can consume in a day
[X] TLUFoodMetabolismRate: the base amount a TLU needs to eat each day
[X] TLUWaterMetabolismRate: the amount of water (in liters) metabolized each day per TLU
[X] TLUMaxDaysWithoutFood: number of days an animal can go without food before dying
[X] TLUMaxDaysWithoutWater: number of days an animal can go without water before dying
[X] TLUFoodMax (calculated as 1.25 * TLUFoodMetabolismRate * TLUMaxDaysWithoutFood)
[X] TLUFoodStress (calculated as 0.5 * TLUFoodMetabolismRate * TLUMaxDaysWithoutFood)
[X] TLUWaterMax (1.25 * TLUWaterConsumptionRate * TLUMaxDaysWithoutWater)
[X] TLUWaterStress (0.5 * TLUWaterConsumptionRate * TLUMaxDaysWithoutWater) -- NOT USED
[X] HerdIdealBirthProbability: probability that a TLU gives birth on a given day.
[X] FoodCostOfMovement: Food burned by moving 1km as a fraction of TLUFoodMetabolismRate
[X] WaterCostOfMovement: Water burned by moving 1km as a fraction of TLUWaterMetabolismRate
[x] Probability of TLUs dying from hunger/thirst (fix this): This is taken care of in Herding.adjustHerdSize without needing a parameter

  Conversions:
[X] PFDPerConsumedTLU (currently daysPersonFedByConsumedTLU)
[X] TLUPerPFD (was TLUsToSupport1Herder, then erroneously PFDPerTLU)

Herding: General
[X] MaxTLUsPerHerder: how many TLUs a person can herd
[X] herdVegetationThreshold -- NOT USED but has interesting comment. discuss with Bill and Tim
[X] visionAndMovementRange: used to calculated migration range (optimization)
[X] maxNearbyWaterHoles: keeps waterholes from having to keep track of too many other waterholes (optimization)
[X] herdSplitThreshold: only used in visualization (to calc dot size)
[X] HerdingRestartProbabilityExponent: Controls how quickly a household will give up on herding (larger is more persistent)

Household:
[X] LaborProductionRate: how many person-food-days of wealth produced by one day's labor
[X] DailyTaxRate: tax on all assets
[ ] InitialHouseholdEndowment: Amount of money (food) that a household is given at the start

World:
[x] PermanentWaterThreshold: Waterholes with at least this much flow can never go dry
