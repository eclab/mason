<p>This is an Agent-Based Model (ABM) of a 1,000 mile square region encompassing
    Lake Victoria and the Rift Valley of Eastern Africa. This model represents the
    environment, people, conflict, and migration in the region.
    The area spans the equator and is bounded by latitudes: 7.81133North and
    5.7719979South and longitudes: 28.264East and 42.38066102East.</p>
<p>The environment is represented as 1,600 by 1,600 1km square
    parcels based on GIS data, with grazable land, urban areas, lakes, rivers, and
    some of the Indian Ocean. The weather is based on data collected every 16 days
    for 30km squares covering the whole area.</p>
<p> RiftLand 2.0 (May 2013) Runnable version with no functionality bugs post ONR review.</p>
<p> RiftLand 1.8 (May 2013) optimized to run full region at full population and now 
    includes a programmable disaster.</p>
<p> RiftLand 1.5 (Aug 2012) supported initialization of full population densities.</p>
<p> RiftLand 1.3 (July 2012) included movement of displaced rural people
    moving to cities in search of aid.</p>
<p> The next version 1.1, (July 2012) incorporated change to integrate activities
    agents into one agent per household. </p>
<p> RiftLand 1.2 (July 2012) incorporated a second farming model, this one for high
    intensity farming.</p>
<p> RiftLand 1.0, the third version (May 2012), incorporated household decision-making
    among activities (agents) used to make a living and creates displaced people. The
    displaced population is moved to cities and camps along the road network. This
    version was announced with the ONR program review.</p>
<p>RiftLand 0.2, the second version 0.2 (5 July 2011) was a redesign of the agents to have rural
    households with activities used to make a living (farming, herding,
    and labor) with plans to model urban households and IDPs as urban-level agents.</p>
<p> RiftLand 0.1, the first version (13 July 2010), was based on applying the HerderLand model
    to the Rift Valley. </p>
