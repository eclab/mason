        </table>

        The CampusWorld GeoMASON example shows how to import GIS data, and how to move agents when they are limited to GIS defined paths.

        <p>The simulation starts by reading GIS data describing the buildings, roads, and walkways of the George Mason
            University Fairfax campus.  All the associated attribute data, such
            as building names, are available through inspectors.
            The simulation randomly places agents on the walkways and moves them along. When the agents reach an intersection
            they arbitrarily select a new walkway line segment to continue on.
