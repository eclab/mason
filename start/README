This directory contains some scripts to make it easier to launch MASON
if you prefer not to have to set your CLASSPATH and run MASON from the
command line as per the tutorial documentation.

If you wish to use charting but don't know how to set up your CLASSPATH,
just download JMF, JFreeChart, JCommon, and iText (see the ECJ website)
and place the jmf.jar, jfreechart...jar, jcommon...jar, and itext...jar
files directly in the ecj directory.  The scripts below will find them. 
("..." means "plus some numbers and letters and a dot" :-)

mason.command
	Double-click on this file, or alternatively launch it from the

	like to add, just dump them into the 'mason' directory.  This
	script uses .tcsh.  Runs Java 1.4.x

mason.1.3.1.command
	Identical to mason.command, except that MASON is launched under
	Java 1.3.1
