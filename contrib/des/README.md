MASON DES Extensions Repository

This library contains extensions to MASON to include discrete event simulation
facilities.  The parent directory (contrib/des) is the CLASSPATH entry.
See docs/manual.pdf for an extension description of the facility and how
to use it.  A very simple application can be found in sim/app/desexample.
