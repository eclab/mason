/** 
	A subclass of Source which, when stepped, provides resources to Receivers by first requesting them
	from a Provider via a pull operation (calling provide()).  The amount of resources and
	the timing of the steps are exactly the same as described in Source.  Unlike Source, capacity
	is ignored and getCapacity() and setCapacity() do nothing.
	
	<p>Extractors are Receivers but are not designed to receive things via push, only via pull.
	Thus you should not register them as receivers of a given Provider.  Instead you should 
	attach an Extractor to a Provider via its setProvider() method or in its constructor.
