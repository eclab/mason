/**
   A Macro encapsulates a subgraph of DES objects.  This subgraph consists of objects of three types.
   First there are receivers that the outside world might send resources to.  Second there are
   providers that might provide resources to the outside world.  Third, there are the "middlemen"
   in the graph which do not interact with the outside world.  To add an outside-world receiver
   to the graph, call addReceiver().  To add an outside-world provider to the graph, call addProvider().
   To add a middleman, call add().  You are responsible for wiring your graph up internally.  Macro
   at present does not have a way to clone its subgraphs.
   
   <p>When a Macro is stepped, it simply steps all of its steppables in turn.  Named objects are only
   stepped if you have indicated that they should be so when adding them to the Macro.  
   You technically don't need to add objects which aren't
   going to be stepped at all, presuming you have wired them up yourself.
