/**
   A composer composes multiple resources received from a provider into a single Entity to offer to
   downstream receivers.  To do this you provide a TEMPLATE for the composer, which specifies which
   entities must be present in the composition, and how much (min, max) of each.  When this template
   is filled properly, the composer can build the entity and send it on.  It will send it on
   immediately, upon receiving the last resource, if getOffersImmediately() is true (by default it is).
   Othewise it will wait until step() is called.  Thus you only need (and only should) schedule
   the Composer if you have turned off setOffersImmediately(false).
