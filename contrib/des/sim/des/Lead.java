/**
   A LEAD is attached between a provider and a receiver somewhere UPSTREAM of its associated
   PROBE.   With the LEAD installed, a Probe
   can also be used to measure the utilization, average idle time, current sum resources between
   the In and the Probe, and so on.
   
   <p> You should attach a Lead upstream of a Probe and generally in such a position that the Probe cannot
   receive any resources via some route other than through the Lead, and similarly the Lead cannot send
   resources out via any route other than through the Probe.  Otherwise resource statistics will be lost
   between the two and I'm not positive what the behavior would be.
