/** 
    A source of resources.  You will typically subclass Source to provide resources in a custom
    way appropriate to your simulation.   The default works more or less as follows.  Upon being
    stepped, the Source determines the NEXT timestep to be stepped using either a distribution or
    a deterministic value you have provided.  It then determines the AMOUNT of resource to produce
    this time around, again using either a distribution or a determinstic value yu have provided.
    It then produces the resources, reschedules itself, and offers resources to registered receivers.
    Sources have a maximum CAPACITY, which by default is infinite.
    
    <p>You can override this in several ways.  First, if the Source produces Entities, you can override
    buildEntity to customize the nature of the Entities generated.  Second, you can turn off the Source's
    auto-rescheduling, and schedule the Source yourself how you see fit.  Third, you can completely
    customize the Source's production, rescheduling, etc. by overriding the update() method.
