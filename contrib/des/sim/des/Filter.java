/** 
    A convenience superclass for DES objects which accept offers and immediately 
    turn around in zero time and offer them to a single downstream receiver.  This
    class largely exists to include a bunch of boilerplate variables and methods
    common to all these kinds of objects.
    
    <p>Because they're just passing on their resource, Filter objects don't place
    the resource in the Entities list or in the resource pool; they just stash it
    and hand it on.  This is one as follows:
    
    <ul>
    <li>First the Filter has its accept(...) method called.
    
    <li>The accept(...) method then calls the offerReceivers(..., ..., ...) method.
    By default offerReceivers(..., ..., ...) will store the accepted resource, 
    the atLeast value, and the atMost value in three protected instance variables 
    called _amount, _atLeast, and _atMost respectively.
    
    <li>The offerReceivers(..., ..., ...) method then calls offerReceivers() to
    offer the resource as appropriate.
    
    <li>The accept(...) method then calls process(...) to process statistics on
    the amount accepted and successfully offered.  By default this method does
    nothing.
    </ul>
    
    <p>Filter subclasses can and do override any of these methods.  Because of a lot
    of rearranging, it is possible that Filter may be eliminated or folded into
    another class in the near future, so be prepared for that possibility.
    
    <p>The default version of Filter merely accepts resources, immediately offers
    them to downstream receivers, and that's it.n
