/** 
    A CountableResource is a Resource which can be merged with resources of the same type.  CountabeResources
    have AMOUNTS, which must be integers >= 0.  CountableResources are thus finitely divisible.
    You can also split a CountableResource into a group of smaller CountableResources, and can 
    compare their amounts against each other.
        
    <p>Examples of CountableResources might be: cars, bricks, workers, and so on.  Money is also
    a countableResource as it is not infinitely divisible: but we have a special subclass for
    Money so it prints out in a cute way.
        
    <p>These amounts are stored as doubles for two bad reasons: first, to allow 
    UncountableResource to cleanly subclass from Resource, and second, because double has a 
    larger range of integers than int does.
        
    <p>CountableResource has a subclass called UncountableResource, which represents infinitely
    divisible resources (like water or gasoline).  This subclass arrangement may seem strange at
    first, but it makes sense given that UncountableResources can do everything CountableResources
    can do, plus some extra things.
