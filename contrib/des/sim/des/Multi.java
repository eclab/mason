/**
   MULTI is a general Steppable object which is meant to enable objects which Provide and Receive multiple channels and multiple resources.
   For example, if you want to build a single object which takes Seats, Frames, and Tires and produces Bicycles and Trash, you could do it
   with a Multi.  To do this, Multi maintains an array of Receivers and a separate array of Providers.  Outside providers can offer
   resources to the Multi by offering to one of its Receivers as appropriate: and in turn, the Multi can offer to outside Receivers by 
   having one of its Providers make the offer.  Each of the Multi's Receivers is specified by a receiver port, which is just its position
   in the array.  Similarly each of the Multi's Providers is specified by a provider port.  The Receivers and Providers are created 
   during initialization, where you pass in the typical Resource for each one of them.
