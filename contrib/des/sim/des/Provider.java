/**
   A provider of resources. Providers also have a TYPICAL PROVIDED resource, 
   which exists only to provide a resource type.  Providers also have
   a RESOURCE, initially zero, of the same type, which is used as a 
   pool for resources.  The Provider class does not use the resource
   variable, and only makes it available as a convenience for subclasses
   to use as they see fit.  
   
   <p>A provider has any number of RECEIVERS which register
   themselves with it.  When a provider is ready to make an offer, it will
   do so using the offerReceivers() method, which offers to the receivers
   using one of several POLICIES.  Offers can be normal or TAKE-IT-OR-LEAVE-IT
   offers.
