     *  <p>Here is the general documentation for Receiver.accept():
     *           
     *  <p>If the resource is a COUNTABLE or UNCOUNTABLE resource of some kind,
     *  The provider may respond by removing between atLeast and atMost, inclusive,
     *  from the given amount, and returning TRUE, or returning FALSE if it refuses
     *  the offer.
     *           
     *  <p>If the resource is an ENTITY of some kind,
     *  The provider may respond by taking the entity and returning TRUE, 
     *  or returning FALSE if it refuses the offer.  atLeast and atMost may be ignored,
     *  but generally atLeast should be 0 and atMost should be 1.
     *  
     *  <p>May throw a RuntimeException if the resource does not
     *  match the typical resource of the receiver, or if a cycle was detected in accepting
     *  offers (A offers to B, which offers to C, which then offers to A).
     *  At present does not check that atLeast and atMost are valid.
     *   
     *  <p>It must be the case that 0 &lt;= atLeast &lt; = atMost &lt;= resource.getAmount(), 
     *  or else a RuntimeException may be thrown. 
     *  
     *  <p>Receivers must never accept 0 of any resource.  Thus if atLeast = 0, then this has
     *  a special meaning: it means that the receiver must accept &gt; atLeast, rather than
     *  &gt;= atLeast. Similarly, Providers should never provide atMost=0.

        Very commonly this Provider and Receiver are one and the same: they are also a Middleman or perhaps a Multi.
        But this does not have to be the case.

        cyclic, and type compatibility checks have already been performed, but you might still benefit from

        For requested CountableResources, I suggest that the amount returned in response to a request would best be
        (int)(X * atLeastRequested / atMost), but you can do as your model deems appropriate.
