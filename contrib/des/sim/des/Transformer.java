/**
   A currency converter, so to speak.  Transformer takes a RESOURCE and returns a COUNTABLE RESOURCE, 
   normally of a different type, by converting the value of the resource into the value of the new one,
   and then offering the new resource.
        
   <p>If the original resource was also a countable resource, then it is converted by multiplying it by 
   a conversion factor.  For example, if we were converting dollars to euros, and one dollar was worth 
   1.5 euros, we might set the conversion to 1.5.  If the downstream receiver accepts the offer but only
   partially, then the original resource is modified accordingly according to the conversion factor.
        
   <p>If the original resource was an Entity, then we simply offer the conversion factor.  Thus one entity
   might be worth 1.5 euros.  By default, if the original resource type is an Entity, Transformer is 
   automatically set to take-it-or-leave-it offers.  Thus if the downstream receiver must accept the offer
   totally.  You can change this by setting take-it-or-leave-it to false; now if the downstream receiver
   accepts the offer only partially, the Entity is consumed regardless.
