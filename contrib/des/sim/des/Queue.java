    amount of space.  Resources placed in the queue by default are offered to downstream
    recievers immediately.  You can change this behavior by setting setOffersImmediately(false).
    Whenever it is stepped by the Schedule, the Queue will also offer to its receivers.  You can
    prevent this by not scheduling it in the first place.  Like all Providers, the Queue will
    make an offer if possible to any Receiver that requests one via provide(...).
